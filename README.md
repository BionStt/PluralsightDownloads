# PluralsightDownloads
For subscribers who don't have the pro subscription and want to follow along without the exercise files, there are still some things you'll need such as databases. I'll include those here.

You can grab the database files without cloning. On the github site, just right click the mdf and "Save Link As..."

I've added AdventureWorksLT.mdf to the downloads. This is used in a few courses including 2017's "Cross-Platform SQL Server Management for Developers" course (http://bit.ly/PS_MSSQL)
